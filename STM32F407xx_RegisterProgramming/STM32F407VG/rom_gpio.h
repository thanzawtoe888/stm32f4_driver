/*
LD1 COM: LD1 default status is red. LD1 turns to green to indicate that communications are in progress between the PC and the ST-LINK/V2-A.

• LD2 PWR: red LED indicates that the board is powered.

• User LD3: orange LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD13 of the STM32F407VGT6.

• User LD4: green LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD12 of the STM32F407VGT6.

• User LD5: red LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD14 of the STM32F407VGT6. 

• User LD6: blue LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PD15 of the STM32F407VGT6. 

• USB LD7: green LED indicates when VBUS is present on CN5 and is connected to PA9 of the STM32F407VGT6. 

• USB LD8: red LED indicates an over-current from VBUS of CN5 and is connected to the I/O PD5 of the STM32F407VGT6.

B1 USER: User and Wake-Up buttons are connected to the I/O PA0 of the STM32F407VG
